### Install manually

To use the theme in your Code::Blocks IDE, it is necessary to add the theme to your "default.conf" file.

On Windows, this file is located at:

```
%APPDATA%\CodeBlocks\default.conf
```

On Linux, this file is located at:

```
~/.config/codeblocks/default.conf
```

- Open the file in a text editor of your choice and search for **"<colour_sets>"**.
- Then copy the entire contents of the file **"Dracula.txt"** from the repository and paste inside the tag **"<colour_sets>"**.
- After that just open the IDE and choose the Dracula theme.
